\section{Overall}
\subsection{Quantitative notation}
A change in a quantity $x$ is represented $\Delta x$. The change in $x$ is always its final value
minus the initial.
$$ \Delta x = x_f - x_i $$
where $x_f$ is the final value and $x_i$ is the initial.

\subsection{Graphs}
The tangent of a curve gives its gradient at that point.
